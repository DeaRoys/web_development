    <p>
        Badminton is a racquet sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or 
        two pairs (doubles) who use racquets to hit a shuttlecock over a net. The goal 
        is to hit the shuttlecock so it lands on the opponent's side of the court, and 
        players score points when the shuttlecock lands in bounds or when the opponent 
        fails to return the shuttlecock successfully.
